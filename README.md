#Prime Numbers and related methods

Methods to allow the user to list prime numbers within a given range.

This also includes a boolean method that returns whether a number is a prime number.
I have included two test classes for the key method (isPrime ()). 

I am aware Prime Numbers feature quite heavily in interviews so wanted to show my understanding of this topic.
